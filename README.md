# Simple-opinion-system

RESTful API. With products and opinions. 

**Methods:**
* list of products
* list of opinions for each product
* add new opinion
* delete opinion

As a database I used **MySQL** run on docker. I used **Spring boot data JPA** and **Hibernate** to connect to the database. 
Opinion has ***average rating*** field that is updated each time someone add a new opinion to the product.
